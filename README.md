# JWT Experimentation with OCT, RSA and JOSE Libraries
This repository contains Python notebook files for exploring different JWT (JSON Web Token) scenarios using the key types 'oct' and 'RSA', as well as the JOSE (Javascript Object Signing and Encryption) libraries.

The notebooks demonstrate how to generate, sign, and verify JWTs, and provide examples of how to handle different errors and exceptions that can arise during this process.

This is an experimental project aimed at helping developers gain a better understanding of how JWTs work and how they can be implemented in their own applications. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it an ideal starting point for anyone looking to dive deeper into the world of JWTs.
